README:

Just run the PP4.py file to get the necessary graphs.
The oneD_main() essentially runs all of "Visualizing performance on the 1D dataset" section. 
plot_performance_curves() should take care of "Performance as a function of iterations" and
"Comparison to Bayesian Linear Regression" plots and actual MSE and 
alpha, beta values.
