Just run the PP2.py file to get the 4 plots for the 4 dataset as per Task 1. For further drilldown,
I also generated a table in the terminal with the lambda that generates the lowest MSE for each dataset

For Task 2 and 3 to run, just close the window with the plots for the code to go to the Task 2/3 section.
These sections will also print out the necessary information in the terminal as per the assignment's instructions.
